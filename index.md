## 👋 About Me

I am currently a Phd student (from fall, 2023) at the [School of Data Science and Engineering](https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/) of [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) and a member of the [Decision Intelligence Lab](https://decisionintelligence.github.io/index), advised by Prof. [Jilin Hu](https://hujilin1229.github.io/) and Prof. [Bin Yang](https://binyangdk.github.io/). I also work closely with Prof. [Christian S. Jensen ](https://csj.cs.aau.dk/).

#### 🔍 Research Topics

My research interests cover Time Series Analysis and Deep Learning. I am currently working on foundation time series models, and time series benchmarking. I have published several relevant papers in top conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hal0V_AAAAAJ'>google scholar citations 813</a>. In addition to pure research, I also dedicate myself to promoting research on valuable real-world applications. My research aims to contribute to the advancement of intelligent systems capable of handling massive and complicated temporal data across domains, including finance, industry, and environment.

For more information, you may take a look at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=Hal0V_AAAAAJ) and [GitHub](https://github.com/qiu69).
